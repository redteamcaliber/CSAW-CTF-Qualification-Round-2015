Step 1:

This was my very first Recon challenge. The challenge tells you to start at fuzyll.com/csaw2015/start.

Step 2: 
I need to find the acronym for his university's hacking club. After searching his LinkedIN, I saw Alex went to University of South Florida and he was president of the Whitehatters Computer Security Club (wcsc).

Step 3:
This string is clearly base64 decode. I just pulled it into https://www.base64decode.org/ and decoded.

Step 4:
For this part, I searched his handle on YouTube. Very first result, Yoshi.

I downloaded Yoshi and opened with Notepad. Next challenge is to find the first cryptosystem Alex had to break at his first Def Con qualifier. I spent a lot of time roaming through 2011 and realized the answer was in 2010 Def Con Qualifiers (facepalm)

Answer Enigma

Step 5:
